Makepath Python
===============

Author: Sean Reifschneder <jafo@tummy.com>

Overview
--------

This is a simple program that demonstrates Test Driven Development for
Jeffery Haemer.  He wrote a "makepath" script, which is a simple "mkdir -p"
implementation, but used test driven development to do it.

He asked me to show him how I would implement such a thing in Python using
Test Driven Develoment techniques, after I gave a presentation on how TDD
helped me to achieve the, seemingly impossible, at a code retreat
(implementation of Conway's Game of Life in under 45 minutes).
